            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>What is CloudCrypt?</h3>
            <p>CloudCrypt is a software for automatic encryption and decryption of data 
            stored in the cloud. This means, that CloudCrypt automatically encrypts 
            the user's data before uploading it to the cloud in order to protect 
            the user's privacy.</p>
            <p>In the first version of CloudCrypt only <i>Dropbox</i> is supported 
            as a cloud-service, but it is planned to add support for other services 
            in later releases.</p>
            <p>CloudCrypt is completely open-source. This means, that the source 
            code of the software is open to everyone. The software is provided 
            under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3
            (GNU LGPLv3). Additionally, we only used libraries in our software,
            which are open-source themselves. This enables every user to 
            take a look at the source code and he may also improve it or change it 
            according to his own needs.</p>
            <p>The whole program is written in Python 3. Python is one of the 
            most powerful languages and yet easy to use, so it did fit our needs 
            quite perfectly. The library used for the graphical interface is Qt5,
            which is portable and offers a huge amount of features. Cryptographic 
            operations are performed by the <i>GNU Privacy Guard</i> (also <i>GPG</i> 
            or <i>GnuPG</i>).</p>
            
            <h3>How did CloudCrypt come into existence?</h3>
            <p>CloudCrypt is a students' project at University of Applied Sciences 
            Upper Austria, Campus Hagenberg. The project was realized by three 
            students in the 4th semester in the course <i>Secure Information Systems</i>.</p>
            <p>While researching cloud-computing and its security aspects we 
            noticed, that a lot of cloud-service providers do not really protect
            the user's data by storing their data in an encrypted form. Instead 
            they often perform an encrypted transfer of the data from the client 
            to the cloud's servers, but then saving them unencrypted.</p>
            <p>We the looked for some third-party software, which may provide 
            this functionality, but we quickly came to the conclusion, that 
            such software is (most of the time) either hard to use or provided 
            under proprietary licenses.</p>
            <p>So we decided to write such a software on our own. The original 
            idea, however, came from our professor and project supervisor 
            FH-Prof. Dr. DI J&uuml;rgen Fu&szlig;.</p>
