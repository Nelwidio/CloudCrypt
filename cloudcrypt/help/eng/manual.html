<h3>Usage of the software</h3>

<p>After starting the software the following window should open up:</p>
<img src="pics/pic_complete_window.png" alt="Complete window">
<p>In the tab <i>Settings</i> you can choose the directory for your unencrypted 
data. You should create a new directory for that purpose and avoid choosing 
another one. The result may be the encryption and synchronization of a huge lot 
of data, which is (most probably) not intended.</p><img src="pics/pic_button_choose.png" alt="Choose">
<p>In the line below you can choose the local directory of your cloud-service. 
This is the place where your data will be copied to after encrypting it. Of course, 
you data will only be uploaded to the cloud when choosing the correct directory
of the cloud you are using.</p>
<p>In the two following lines you can enter your password. If the passwords do 
not match or do not satisfy the security policy, the lines will be colored in 
red. If the passwords are valid the lines will be green.</p>
<img src="pics/pic_passwords_correct.png" alt="passwords correct">
<p>With the buttons <img src="pics/pic_button_show.png" alt="Show passwords">
you can make the passwords visible. The passwords will only be visible as long 
as you click on the buttons.</p>
<p>After ticking the checkbox <img src="pics/pic_show_toolips.png" alt="Show tooltips">
most of the elements in the interface will display short descriptions about their
purpose and usage. The tooltips are visible when hovering your cursor over the 
element.</p>
<p>After ticking the checkbox <img src="pics/pic_show_advtab.png" alt="Advanced settings">
a new tab will appear in the window. In this tab you can edit the most settings 
of the software manually, delete them or setting them back to defaults</p>
<table><tr>
<th style="width: 34px">
<img src="pics/pic_sign_warning.png" alt="Warning" style="height: 50px; width: auto"></th>
<td><b>Warning: By modifying the settings you may influence the usability and/or 
the stability of the software in a negative way. This may also lead to to inability 
to read your encrypted data. For a normal user there is no reason to edit the 
settings manually.</b></td>
</tr></table>
<p>In the tab <i>Settings</i> there is a button down at the bottom which says
<img src="pics/pic_button_write_config.png" alt="Write config">. With this button 
you can write the config file after you edited the settings manually. The config
file will be written by starting the synchronization or quitting the application, too.</p>
<p>With the slider at the bottom right corner of the window you can start and 
stop the synchronization (if you have entered all required values). When starting 
the software will start the encryption of your data and will copy them to the 
cloud folder. Afterwards this procedure will be executed reversely (so your data 
will also be synchronized from the cloud). If a file already exists in its 
opposite directory, the file will only be copied if the file is newer than the
other one. The whole procedure will be repeated every 30 seconds, until you 
stop the synchronization.</p>
<p><b>Notice:</b> We can not influence the time when your cloud service will 
really synchronize the files to the cloud server. This depends on the cloud service, 
you network load and some other factors. CloudCrypt just copies and encrypts files 
on the local system.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the window there is a message area where important messages 
like errors will be displayed. For example, if your passwords are not equal you 
will be informed about it here.</p>

<h3>Some important notes</h3>

<table><tr>
<th style="width: 34px">
<img src="pics/pic_sign_warning.png" alt="Warning" style="height: 50px; width: auto"></th>
<td>If you want to store unencrypted data in your cloud you must do this manually.
You should create a new folder for this purpose because of CloudCrypt completely
ignoring unencrypted files inside the cloud folder.</td>
</tr></table>
<br>
<table><tr>
<th style="width: 34px">
<img src="pics/pic_sign_warning.png" alt="Warning" style="height: 50px; width: auto"></th>
<td>You should NEVER edit the files of the software manually. This can - in the 
worst case scenario - lead to the incapability to read your encrypted data. 
Do not edit the files and create backups of your data regularly.</td>
</tr></table>

<th style="width: 34px">
<img src="pics/pic_sign_warning.png" alt="Warning" style="height: 50px; width: auto"></th>
<td>In order to use the software on another system, you should simply copy 
the while folder of CloudCrypt to the second system (after starting the software for 
the first time). Afterwards you may most probably have to change the directories 
for the plain data and the cloud. With this procedure your data should be 
readable and your password should be the same on both systems.</td>
