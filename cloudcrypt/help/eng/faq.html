            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is CloudCrypt?</h3>
            <p>CloudCrypt is a software, which allows a user to save his personal 
            data in a cloud, after automatically encrypted.</p>
            <h3>What is the license CloudCrypt is provided under?</h3>
            <p>CloudCrypt is provided under the GNU Lesser General Public License 
            Version 3 (LGPLv3).</p>
            <h3>Why do you use a open-source license?</h3>
            <p>The students creating CloudCrypt are supporters of the open-source 
            movement. It is important for us, that a user of a software is able 
            to have the absolute control over his software. This includes an 
            open source-code and the right to improve the software or to modify 
            it according to one's needs. A common misconception is the thinking, 
            that free software must always be free of charge. According to 
            Dr. Richard Stallman (one of the founders of the open-source movement)
            <i>free</i> in <i>free software</i> refers to <i>free</i> in 
            <i>freedom</i>, not in <i>free beer</i>, although we agreed not to 
            charge any money for CloudCrypt.</p>
            <h3>Which encryption is used?</h3>
            <p>All data, you store in the cloud with CloudCrypt is encrypted 
            with the <i>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</i> with a keylength
            of 256 bits. We are not using an own implementation of AES, of course. 
            Instead we use the GNU Pricacy Guard.</p>
            <h3>Does CloudCrypt have any requirements?</h3>
            <p>In order to use CloudCrypt properly, you have to meet the following 
            requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a standard PC or notebook</li>
                <li>Microsoft Windows 7 or higher or a distribution of Linux</li>
                <li>Python Version 3.x</li>
                <li>PyQt5</li>
                <li>GNU Privacy Guard</li>
                <li>a valid account of <i>Dropbox</i></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Which are the cloud-services supported by CloudCrypt?</h3>
            <p>At the moment we support <i>Dropbox</i> only.</p>
